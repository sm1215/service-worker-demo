// If using Chrome, you can check the status of service workers by visiting:
// chrome://inspect/#service-workers

// Another useful address is chrome://serviceworker-internals and can show information about the SW lifecycle

      // Success
      console.log(`SW registered successfully with scope ${registration.scope}`);

      // The scope of the SW is determined by the location of the SW file itself. 
      // Example:
      // 1) If registered at the root of a domain, SW has root level scope and can receive fetch events for everything on the domain.
      // 2) If registered at root/example, SW has a scope of example and will only see events for that page or it's children.
